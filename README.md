# Income-Predictions
Random Forest Classifier

In this project, I was using a dataset containing census information from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository.

By using this census data with a random forest, I tried to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.

The project was complited in Python 3, using Pandas, Numpy and Sklearn.
